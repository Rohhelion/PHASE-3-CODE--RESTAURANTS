Object Relations Code Challenge - Restaurants
Welcome to the Object Relations Code Challenge - Restaurants project! This project involves building a Yelp-style domain to manage information about restaurants, customers, and reviews. The goal is to practice object-oriented programming concepts, such as class relationships, instance methods, and class methods in Python.

Project Overview
In this project, we have three main models:

Restaurant: Represents a restaurant and has a one-to-many relationship with Review.
Customer: Represents a customer and has a one-to-many relationship with Review.
Review: Represents a review given by a customer for a specific restaurant.

Features
This project implements the following features:

Creating instances of Restaurant, Customer, and Review.
Adding reviews for restaurants by customers using the add_review method.
Retrieving information about customers, restaurants, and reviews.
Displaying average star ratings for restaurants.
Finding customers and restaurants by name.
Usage
Define the classes: Make sure that the customer.py, restaurant.py, and review.py files contain the necessary class definitions.

Run the testing.py script to test the implemented features:
